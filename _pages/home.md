### About me

I am professor and researcher of the Computer Science Department of [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es) in Mexico.

My research focuses on the development of innovative solutions to address technical and scientific problems related to health, gravitational wave astronomy, and educational innovation.


### Research in Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interfaces

Visit the [NTLab](http://gravitationalwaves.mx/)

// I lead the *Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interfaces Laboratory (NTLab)* where I work in the desing, implementation, testing, and delivering of robust and reliable technologies that provide novel communication, mobility, rehabilitation and treatment solutions for people with neurodegenerative and neurological diseases and affected by the natural aging.

// I design and perform experiments with healthy and non-healthy participants to acquire biomedical and behavioral data in daily life situations and I use AI methods for the analysis, interpretation and decoding of such recordings aiming to understanding neuro-motor/cognitive mechanisms.

###  Research in computational statistics and AI for gravitational waves

Visit the [Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Group](http://gravitationalwaves.mx/)

// <I am member of the [Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Group](http://gravitationalwaves.mx/) where I am in charge of the computational statistics and Artificial Intelligence computational tools and data analysis techniques for search, detection and characterization of gravitational waves from diferent astrophysical sources such as binary black holes (BBH) and supernovae (SN).

// I focus in the implementation of AI and Bayesian inference techniques. I am particularly interested in the parameter estimation of gravitationals waves from core-collapse supernovae.>
