### About me

I am professor and researcher of the Computer Science Department of [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es) in Mexico.

My research focuses on the development of innovative solutions to address technical and scientific problems related to health, gravitational wave astronomy, and educational innovation.



### Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interfaces

I lead the Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interfaces Laboratory (NTLab) where we work in the desing, implementation, testing, and delivering of robust and reliable technologies that provide novel communication, mobility and rehabiltation alternatives for people affected by illnesses and accidents. 

The technologies developed in my lab are devoted to the examination, diagnosis, neurorehabilitation, treatment and follow-up of neurodegenerative diseases and neurological and chronic disorders originated by diseases and natural aging.

I use artificial intelligence methods for the analysis, interpretation and decoding of biomedical and behavioral data in daily life situations.


### Computational Statistics and Artificial Intelligence for Gravitational Waves

Computational statistics and computational neuroscience techniques for the  decoding and interpretation of GW and the identification and decoding of neural markers.
