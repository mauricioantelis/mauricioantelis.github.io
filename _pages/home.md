### About me

I am professor and researcher of the Computer Science Department of [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es) in Mexico.

My research focuses on the development of innovative solutions to address technical and scientific problems related to health, gravitational wave astronomy, and educational innovation.



### Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interfaces

I lead the *Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interfaces Laboratory (NTLab)* where I work in the desing, implementation, testing, and delivering of robust and reliable technologies that provide novel communication, mobility, rehabiltation and treatment solutions for people with neurodegenerative and neurological diseases and affected by the natural aging.

I design and perform experiments with healthy and non-healthy participants to acquire biomedical and behavioral data in daily life situations and I use AI methods for the analysis, interpretation and decoding of such recordings aiming to understanding neuro-motor/cognitive mechanisms.


### Computational Statistics and Artificial Intelligence for Gravitational Waves

I am member of the *Data Analisis for Gravitational Waves Research group* where I am in charge of the computational tools and data analysis techniques for search, detection and characterization of gravitational waves.

I focus in the implementation of AI and Bayesian inference techniques.

I am particularly interested in the parameter estimation of gravitationals waves from core-collapse supernovae.
