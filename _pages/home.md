### About me

I am professor and researcher of the Computer Science Department of [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/es) in Mexico. My research focuses on the development of innovative solutions to address technical and scientific problems related to health, gravitational wave astronomy, and educational innovation.


I lead the [Neurotechnology and Brain-Computer Interface Laboratory (NTLab)](http://gravitationalwaves.mx/) where I work in the desing of technologies to provide novel communication, mobility, rehabilitation and treatment solutions for people with neurodegenerative and neurological diseases and affected by the natural aging. I use AI methods for the analysis, interpretation and decoding of neural data.

I am co-leader of the [Gravitational Wave Data Analysis Group](http://gravitationalwaves.mx/) where I am in charge of the research activities in computational statistics and AI for gravitational waves detection and parameter estimation.  I focus in the implementation and deployment of machine/deep learning methods and Bayesian inference techniques.
